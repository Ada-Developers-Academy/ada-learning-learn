# Creating Content using a Text Editor

As our Learn lessons get more complex, it will be helpful to write Learn content using a text editor, rather than on GitHub.

To create content locally, we need to learn how to update content on **GitHub** using the tool **git**.

Creating content locally on our computer in a text editor will make it easier to navigate the course file structure. In addition, it allows us to preview the content we create in Learn.

## Instructional Staff

Instructional Staff should continue to the Instructional Staff Unit and review the following topics: 
    - Creating A Lesson
    - Coding Assignments
    - Grading Intro

Instructors may choose to review the first topic, **Setting Up Course**, but note that they will not have the authorization to create new courses.
