# Creating Content using a Text Editor

As our Learn lessons get more complex, it will be helpful to write Learn content using a text editor, rather than on GitHub.

Creating content locally on our computer in a text editor will make it easier to navigate the course file structure. In addition, it allows us to preview the content we create in Learn.
